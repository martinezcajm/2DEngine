\subsection*{Introduction}

This example is the default X\+Code \char`\"{}\+Open\+G\+L\char`\"{} example code, modified to support Im\+Gui and \href{http://synergy-project.org/}{\tt Synergy} to share mouse/keyboard on an i\+OS device.

It is a rather complex and messy example because of all of the faff required to get an X\+Code/i\+OS application running. Refer to the regular Open\+GL examples if you want to learn about integrating Im\+Gui. {\bfseries The opengl3\+\_\+example/ should also work on OS X and is much simpler.} This is an integration for i\+OS with Synergy.

Synergy (remote keyboard/mouse) is not required, but it\textquotesingle{}s pretty hard to use Im\+Gui without it. Synergy includes a \char`\"{}u\+Synergy\char`\"{} library that allows embedding a synergy client, this is what is used here. Im\+Gui supports \char`\"{}\+Touch\+Padding\char`\"{}, and this is enabled when Synergy is not active.

\subsection*{How to Use on i\+OS}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In Synergy, go to Preferences, and uncheck \char`\"{}\+Use S\+S\+L encryption\char`\"{}
\item Run the example app.
\item Tap the \char`\"{}servername\char`\"{} button in the corner
\item Enter the name or the IP of your synergy host
\item If you had previously connected to a server, you may need to kill and re-\/start the app.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{How to Build on O\+SX}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure you have install {\ttfamily brew}, if not, please refer to \href{http://brew.sh}{\tt Homebrew Website}
\item Run the command\+: {\ttfamily brew install glfw3}
\item Double click {\ttfamily imguiex.\+xcodeproj} and select {\ttfamily imguiex-\/osx} scheme
\item Click {\ttfamily Run} button
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Notes and T\+O\+D\+Os}

Things that would be nice but I didn\textquotesingle{}t get around to doing\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item i\+OS software keyboard not supported for text inputs
\item i\+OS hardware (bluetooth) keyboards not supported
\item Graceful disconnect/reconnect from u\+Synergy.
\item Copy/\+Paste not well-\/supported
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{C++ on i\+OS / O\+SX}

Im\+Gui is a c++ library. If you want to include it directly, rename your Obj-\/C file to have the \char`\"{}.\+mm\char`\"{} extension.

Alternatively, you can wrap your debug code in a C interface, this is what I am demonstrating here with the \char`\"{}debug\+\_\+hud.\+h\char`\"{} interface. Either approach works, use whatever you prefer.

In my case, most of my game code is already in C++ so it\textquotesingle{}s not really an issue and I can use Im\+Gui directly.
